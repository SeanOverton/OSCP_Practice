# OSCP_Practice
A collection of my raw docs I have been taking notes in as I take on the journey of studying for the OSCP using resources from OSPG and HackTheBox mainly. As the exam changed in early 2021 I have decided to further practice my Windows skills before taking on the exam. 

Note: I am very aware of the extensive resources that already exist but I also acknowledge how important it is for me to:
  1) Actually practice the practical skills myself and more importantly the thought processes involved. 
  2) Take my own notes and reflect on what I have learnt regularly and where I need to improve. 
For these reasons I decided to make my own notes as below.

WARNING:
They are very raw and have slowly been improving in detail and usefulness as I have progressed.
